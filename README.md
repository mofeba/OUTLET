# OUTLET
This is a simplified version of the implementation of a software product solution I designed to help urban EV owners book level 1 charger 
for overnight charging.

EV OWNERS CAN:
LOCATE AVAILABLE CHARGERS
ADD NEW CHARGING PORTS
BOOK CHARGER
END CHARGING AND PAY CURRENT ENERGY MARKET COST

To execute:
python main.py
# or depending upon your config
python3 main.py
